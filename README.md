# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project is to use my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, I will use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results
- During data preporcessing, I removed columns EIN and NAME from the input data.
- I will use IS_SUCCESSFUL column data to consider target for my modeling. And columns APPLICATION_TYPE, APPLICATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS and ASK_AMT are my feature variable for my modeling.
